\section{Vector Spaces}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{A vector space} (or linear space) consists of the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item a field F of scalars;
		\item a set V of objects,called vecots;
		\item a rule (or opearion),called vector addition, which associates with each pair of vectors $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in V a vector $\alpha + \beta$ in V a vector $\alpha + \beta$ in V, called the sun of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ insuch a way that the following conditions hold:
		      \begin{enumerate}
			      \item addition is coommutative: \[
				            \alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha
			            \]
			      \item addition is associative: \[
				            (\alpha + \beta) + \gamma = \alpha + (\beta + \gamma)
			            \]
			      \item there is a unique vector 0 in V,called the zero vector,such that: \[
				            \alpha + 0 = \alpha
			            \]
			      \item for each vector $\alpha$ in V there is a unique vector $-\alpha$ in V such that: \[
				            \alpha + (-\alpha) = 0
			            \]
		      \end{enumerate}
		\item a rule (or operation),called scalar multiplication,which associates with each scalar c in F and vetor $\alpha$ in V a vector $c\alpha$ ,called the product of c and $\alpha$, in such a way that the following conditions hold:
		      \begin{enumerate}
			      \item $1\alpha = \alpha$
			      \item $(c_1c_2)\alpha = c_1(c_2\alpha)$
			      \item $c(\alpha + \beta) = c\alpha + c\beta$
			      \item $(c_1 + c_2)\alpha = c_1\alpha + c_2\alpha$
		      \end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
